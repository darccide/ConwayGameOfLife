### About
This is a simple version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). It is a [zero-player game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-player_game) consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. For every cycle of the game, the cells can be turned on or off based on the following rules:


  * If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it comes to life.
  * If a live cell has less than two live neighbours, it dies.
  * If a live cell has more than three live neighbours, it dies.
  * If a live cell has two or three live neighbours, it continues living.
